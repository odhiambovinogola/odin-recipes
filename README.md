# Odin Recipes

A simple recipe website built as part of [The Odin Project’s](https://www.theodinproject.com) Foundations course.  
The original goal was to create a multi-page HTML site — and later improve it with external CSS for layout and design practice.

## What This Project Includes

The site consists of:

- A **homepage** that lists all available recipes
- Three **individual recipe pages**:
  - Spanish Omelette
  - Fried Chicken
  - Black Forest Cake

Each recipe page includes:

- A clear heading and image
- A brief description of the dish
- An ingredients list
- Step-by-step instructions
- Navigation to return to the homepage

## Styling and Layout

Basic styling is handled through an external `style.css` file, which covers:

- Global resets and font styles
- A clean layout for the homepage and recipe pages
- Utility classes for lists and sections
- Responsive considerations (within limits of the course scope)

---

## Skills Demonstrated

This project helped reinforce:

- Writing semantic, well-structured HTML
- Organizing a multi-page project with proper folder and file structure
- Linking between pages using relative paths
- Styling with external CSS (selectors, class naming, structure)
- Practicing clean Git habits with atomic, meaningful commits

## Reflection

This project was a major step in going from raw HTML to building a full (yet simple) user experience.  
It made me think like a developer — planning layout, naming things clearly, and building in small, testable steps.

> **Biggest takeaway:** Clear structure and clean commits make every next step smoother.  
> This foundation will carry forward as I dive deeper into The Odin Project.
