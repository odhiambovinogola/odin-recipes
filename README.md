# Odin Recipes 🍽️

This is a basic HTML project from The Odin Project’s Foundations course.  
The goal was to build a simple recipe website using only HTML.

## 📌 What the Project Is

The website consists of a homepage (`index.html`) and three separate recipe pages.  
Each recipe page contains:

- A heading
- An image of the dish
- A description
- An ingredients list
- Step-by-step instructions
- Navigation links between pages

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated

By completing this project, I practiced:

- Writing semantic and structured HTML
- Creating multi-page websites using proper folder and file organization
- Navigating between pages using relative paths
- Using HTML elements like headings, paragraphs, images, lists, and links
- Keeping a clean Git history with meaningful, atomic commits

## 🔁 Reflection

This project helped reinforce the basics of writing HTML from scratch without any templates.  
It gave me confidence in structuring web pages logically and working with links and folders.

The biggest win was getting comfortable with thinking about how users move through a website and how HTML content should flow.
I also practiced writing clean, focused Git commits — a habit I’ll continue to sharpen throughout The Odin Project.
