          <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
          <li>
            Heat oil over medium-high heat in a large skillet. Add potatoes and
            season lightly with salt and pepper; cook, stirring occasionally,
            until golden brown and crisp, 10 to 14 minutes. Add onions; cook and
            stir until soft and beginning to brown, 6 to 8 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>Whisk eggs in a bowl; season with salt and pepper.</li>
          <li>
            Pour eggs into the skillet and stir gently to combine with potatoes
            and onion. Reduce the heat to low and cook until eggs begin to brown
            on the bottom, 4 to 5 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Loosen omelette with a spatula. Invert a large plate over the pan,
            and carefully flip omelette out onto the plate. Slide omelette,
            uncooked-side down, back into the pan. Cook until eggs are set, 4 to
            5 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>Serve warm, garnished with tomato and green onion.</li>
