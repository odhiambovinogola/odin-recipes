    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>½ cup olive oil</li>
      <li>½ pound potatoes, thinly sliced</li>
      <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
      <li>1 large onion, thinly sliced</li>
      <li>4 large eggs</li>
      <li>
        2 medium tomatoes - peeled, seeded, and coarsely chopped (Optional)
      </li>
      <li>2 green onions, chopped (Optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
      <li>
        Heat oil over medium-high heat in a large skillet. Add potatoes and
        season lightly with salt and pepper; cook, stirring occasionally, until
        golden brown and crisp, 10 to 14 minutes. Add onions; cook and stir
        until soft and beginning to brown, 6 to 8 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Whisk eggs in a bowl; season with salt and pepper.</li>
      <li>
        Pour eggs into the skillet and stir gently to combine with potatoes and
        onion. Reduce the heat to low and cook until eggs begin to brown on the
        bottom, 4 to 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Loosen omelette with a spatula. Invert a large plate over the pan, and
        carefully flip omelette out onto the plate. Slide omelette,
        uncooked-side down, back into the pan. Cook until eggs are set, 4 to 5
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Serve warm, garnished with tomato and green onion.</li>
    </ol>
