      <li>4 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons dry potato flakes</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons seasoned salt</li>

      <li>2 egg</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Place crackers in a large resealable plastic bag; seal bag and crush

        potato flakes, seasoned salt, and pepper and mix well.

        Beat egg in a shallow dish or bowl. One by one, dredge chicken pieces in
        egg, then place in bag with crumb mixture. Seal bag and shake to coat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees
        C).
      </li>
      <li>
        Fry chicken, turning frequently, until golden brown and juices run
        clear, 15 to 20 minutes.
