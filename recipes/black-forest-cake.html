      <li>¾ cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
      <li>1 ½ teaspoons baking powder</li>
      <li>¾ teaspoon baking soda</li>
      <li>¾ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>3 large eggs</li>
      <li>1 cup milk</li>
      <li>½ cup vegetable oil</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Topping:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 (20 ounce) cans pitted sour cherries</li>
      <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
      <li>¼ cup cornstarch</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Whipped Cream Frosting:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>3 cups heavy whipping cream</li>
      <li>⅓ cup confectioners' sugar</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour two
        9-inch round cake pans; line bottoms with parchment paper. Place a
        medium bowl in the refrigerator to chill before using it to whip the
        cream.
      </li>
      <li>
        Whisk flour, sugar, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together
        in a large bowl.
      </li>
      <li>Add eggs, milk, oil, and vanilla; beat until combined.</li>
      <li>Pour cake batter into the prepared pans.</li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the centers
        comes out clean, about 35 minutes. Cool layers in pans on wire racks for
        10 minutes. Run a paring knife around edges to loosen and invert
        carefully onto racks to cool completely, 1 to 2 hours.
      </li>
      <li>
        While cake layers bake, drain cherries for topping, reserving 1/2 cup
        juice. Combine reserved juice, cherries, sugar, and cornstarch in a
        2-quart saucepan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook, stirring constantly, over low heat until thickened. Stir in
        vanilla. Let cool at room temperature for 30 minutes. Transfer to the
        refrigerator to cool completely before assembling cake.
      </li>
      <li>
        To make the frosting: Combine whipping cream and confectioners' sugar in
        the chilled medium bowl. Beat with an electric mixer at high speed until
        stiff peaks form.
      </li>
      <li>
        Split each cake layer in half horizontally using a long serrated knife.
      </li>
      <li>Tear one layer into crumbs; set aside.</li>
      <li>
        Gently brush loose crumbs off top and sides of remaining layers using a
        pastry brush or your hands. Reserve 1 ½ cups of frosting for piping
        decorations on cake; set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        To assemble, place one cake layer on a cake plate. Spread with 1 cup
        frosting; top with 3/4 cup cherry topping.
      </li>
      <li>
        Top with second cake layer; repeat layers of frosting and cherry
        topping.
      </li>
      <li>Top with third cake layer and frost sides of cake.</li>
      <li>Pat reserved cake crumbs onto sides of cake.</li>
      <li>
        Spoon reserved 1 ½ cups frosting into a pastry bag fitted with a star
        decorator tip. Pipe around top and bottom edges of cake.
      </li>
      <li>Spoon remaining cherry topping on top of cake.</li>
      <li>Store covered in the refrigerator until ready to serve. Enjoy!</li>
